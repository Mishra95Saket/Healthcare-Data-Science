# Heart Disease Prediction — Healthcare Data Science Project

## 🧠 Project Summary

This repository contains an end‑to‑end predictive analytics project using the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset**. The goal is to build an interpretable machine learning model to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on clinical indicators.

**Dataset:** Open UCI Heart Disease dataset — patient clinical attributes and diagnosis label. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## 🧩 Key Business Questions

1. **What factors most strongly influence heart disease diagnosis?**  
   Identify features (age, cholesterol, blood pressure) that correlate with disease outcomes.

2. **Can we predict heart disease accurately using machine learning?**  
   Assess classification performance with metrics like accuracy, ROC‑AUC.

3. **Should additional screening protocols be prioritized for specific high‑risk groups?**  
   Segment high‑risk patients for targeted preventive care.

4. **How could predictive risk scores assist clinical decision support?**  
   Use model outputs to guide early risk stratification.

## 🗃️ Repository Breakdown
